# DinoRunner - An Endless Runner


ï¿¼ ## MVP Features

In RobotRunner, users will be able to:

  - Control an animated robot unicorn
  - See the score they got
  - Hear background sounds and sounds on collisions
  - Restart game
  - See instructions on how to play the game
  - see the game scrolling as the unicorn runs
## Technologies

  - HTML Canvas for DOM rendering.
  - Vanilla JavaScript for game logic
  - Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

## Wireframes

  This app will consist of a single screen with the canvas, game controls and instructions on how to play the game at the bottom of the canvas.

  The canvas will not look exactly like this but since it is very hard to depict how the real game would look like. This is the game that I will be trying to base my game on.
